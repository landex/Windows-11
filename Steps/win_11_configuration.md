* ***7-ZIP:*** To uncompress files with extensions **.rar**, **.tar**, **.zip** and etc...

### Fonts Fira Code

I like the **Fira Code** font, so in this case if you can use too, make download in this link [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/download/6/Fira_Code_v6.zip)

The installation is the very easy, first uncompress the zipped folder downloaded, and in sub folder **ttf** select all files and click with right button and select the option ***install for all users***.

Ok, after installation of Fira Code we can use in your preferred apps.

### VIM

One of the best text editor of world, to edit simple files, when you is using the PowerShell is better have ***vim*** installed in your computer.
